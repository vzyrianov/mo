# mo

An experimental language / C wrapper for building concurrent systems. It takes inspiration from Golang's channels and unix pipes.

The example folder shows how a simple webserver in C (which was aquired from here: https://github.com/rahul003/http-server-client/blob/master/examples/simpleserver.c) could be parallelized with mo.
